prompt: |
  You are a strict logical evaluator.
  Facts: {facts_list}
  Preferences (for resolving conflicts): {preferences}
  Example: if R1>R2, then effects from R1 override effects from R2.
  Question: {question}
  Allowed answers: {poss_answers}
  Instructions:
  1. Use the facts provided, each possibly tagged with its source (db) or (rule_name) in parenthesis.
  2. If facts conflict, apply the preferences list to decide which to keep (higher left wins).
  3. If a fact derived from a rule conflicts with a database fact, the new rule inference takes precedence.
  4. If a fact has unresolvable conflicts after applying instructions 2 and 3, answer 'Unknown'.
  5. Decide the truth of the question using only the consistent fact set.
  Return exactly one value from the allowed answers.
  Do not include any explanation or extra text. Only output the single word answer.
